I'm a Data Scientist finishing a Ph.D. in Biology. I have over 8 years of experience in experimental design, advanced regression modeling, and extracting insights from messy data. I'm excited to apply my background in behavioral analytics in both predicting and interpreting consumer behavior to inform business decision making and in creating data products.
